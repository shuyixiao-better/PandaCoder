## Summary of Changes

This enhancement significantly improves the bug recording functionality in PandaCoder by addressing key limitations in the current implementation:

1. **Enhanced Error Parsing**: 
   - More accurate exception type matching with improved regex patterns
   - Better stack trace parsing with enhanced pattern recognition
   - Detailed error type classification covering more specific scenarios

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Asynchronous processing architecture to prevent IDE freezing
   - Optimized buffering mechanism with configurable timeouts
   - Improved resource management with dedicated thread pools

3. **Advanced Deduplication**:
   - Enhanced fingerprint algorithm using SHA-256 for better uniqueness
   - Content normalization to accurately identify similar errors
   - Smart deduplication that recognizes variants of the same error

4. **Deep Analysis Capabilities**:
   - Multi-dimensional error analysis combining exception type, stack trace, and error messages
   - Root cause identification through caused-by chain analysis
   - Targeted solution suggestions based on error categories

5. **New Features**:
   - Bug aggregation service for trend analysis and insights
   - Enhanced startup activity with better initialization
   - Batch processing capabilities for improved efficiency

These enhancements maintain backward compatibility while delivering significantly better accuracy, performance, and usability for tracking and analyzing bugs in Java applications.
